# Sudoku_Solver
A simple Sudoku puzzle solver.

This makes use of the recursive backtracking algorithm which is implemented in the solve function of solver.py. 

Boards are represented as a 2D numpy array, and are initially made in data.py, where a string of length n^2 is inputted. This uses the puzzle string format as outputted by the QQWing Program.
